Central Ohio Programming Competition 2019 - C#
==============================================

System Requirements
-------------------

- .NET Core 2.2 SDK


Project Setup
-------------

In order to set up the project, there are a couple configuration items to handle. First of all, the .gitlab-ci.yml file must be updated with the name of your project repository for this challenge. Replace GIT_REPO_NAME with the hyphenated name of your Git repository. Please see an organizer for help if needed.

You then need to open the SolutionConfiguration.cs file and add your team information. Do not change this after the beginning of the competition.

Then, just start working on the solution in ChallengeSolution.cs! You can add any other classes, etc., but do not change the name or namespace of the SolutionConfiguration or ChallengeSolution.


Disqualifications
-----------------

Modifying the project in a way that intends to allow the participant or others to cheat or confuse the scoring system will result in an immediate disqualification.
